# AgriGuard Project

## Problem We’re Trying to Solve:
Farmers are using too much fertilizer and pesticides, and it’s not helping. It’s making the soil worse, lowering crop yields, and it’s bad for people’s health. The solution? Use exactly what’s needed, no more. This way, we improve the soil, grow more food, and need fewer farmers to get it done. Simple, right? Work smarter, not harder.

## Project Goals:
1. Improving agriculture and achieving sustainability.
2. Reclaiming agricultural land.
3. Increasing soil fertility.
4. Enhancing production and saving foreign currency.
