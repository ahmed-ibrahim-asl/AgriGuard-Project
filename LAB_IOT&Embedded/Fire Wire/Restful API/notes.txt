- When do we use json.dump ?
    1. you need to return structured data as respond to api request
    2. Save structured data in readable format
    3. sending data over a network 


    [syntax]
    json.dump(obj, file_obj, indent=None, separators=None)

    - obj:      python object you want to convert to json 
    - file_obj: where the json will be written to 
    - indent: adds indentation 
    - seprator: customize item seprator
